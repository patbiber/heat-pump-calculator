# heat-pump-calculator
an old project, but we used this calculations for real projects to change oil heating against heat pumps.

here you see an example: https://biber.solar/heat-pump-calculator/
calculations are based on: https://www.energieschweiz.ch 14 years ago.

It's a simple php page. Easy to understand.
